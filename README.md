We have 4 main tasks in Local Shops - Prices Application:

Task 1: SEARCHING PRODUCT
All registered or non-registered users can perform product search in our application (project). There are two ways to do this: one is to use the search bar and the other is to select the appropriate category from the menu. In addition, if the user is interested, he can also click on the market or product images on the homepage and go to the relevant page. The main feature of our app is that by connecting to the phone's location feature, it only shows all grocery stores at a certain distance where the user lives. The user may want to find the best price or the closest market for product that s/he searches. For this, it can easily find the product it is looking for by using sorting and filtering features.

Task 2: DO MULTIPLE SHOPPING LISTS
People who use our application can use the list creation section to make it easier to buy and remember the products they see the prices of. The user must log in after opening the application to create a shopping list. After logging in, the user goes to the shopping list creation section in the lower bar. The user presses the create list button and gives a name to the list. Then click the add product button to add products to the list. After completing his/her list, the comparison screen appears and the user compares his/her list with other markets. Later, the user can change the list of the market that suits. At the end the users can edit their list if they wishes and share it via social media.

Task 3: ADD MARKET
The market owner must log in after opening the application to add market. If market owner do not have an account, he/she can click "Are you a market owner?" option and fill in the required information. This information comes to the managers and it is investigated whether the person is a real market owner. If the person is a real market owner, his / her account information is transmitted and the market owner logs into the application with this information. On the next screen, a new market can be added, the market information can be updated, the market can be deleted and a surprise discount can be made. For adding market, click the market adding icon and fill in the market information, product information and save the changes.

Task 4: PRODUCT EVALUATION
In order to evaluate a product in a store and write an opinion about it, the user must first log in to the application. Then search for the product to comment and click the comment button, comment and star the product in the market he chooses with the name he created, then press the "send" button. The user can review other comments if he wish.
